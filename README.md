# Ecommerce Analysis
## Project Background
Evertrail is a global e-commerce business offering products across key categories including electronics, books, and clothing. To support leadership in making informed, data-driven decisions, I was tasked with analyzing internal customer, transaction, and product datasets and building an interactive executive dashboard.
## Data Overview
This analysis is based on three core datasets that provide critical insight into Evertrail's e-commerce performance:
- Customer Data: Contains unique customer identifiers, signup dates and regional information. This enables analysis of customer behavior, segmentation, and conversion trends.
- Product Data: Captures all purchase activity, including order dates, quntities, and total value. This dataset helps track revenue, repeat purchases and purchase timing.
- Transactional Data: Provides product-level details including product ID, name, category, and price. This allows us to evaluate high-revenue or high-volume products.

These datasets power a comprehensive analysis of Evertrail's sales trends, customer lifecycle behavior, and product performance across time and regions.

## Executive Summary
Evertrail demonstrates strong overall revenue performance, with Books emerging as the top-performing category by total sales. Only 28.57% of signed-up users convert to paying customers, and most conversions take place 60+ days post-signup, indicating a long sales cycle. Despite this, the average order value is high at $512.58, and more than half of customers who purchase return for additional orders (retention rate: 54.4%), highlighting opportunities to improve early conversion and maximize lifetime value.
## Overview of Findings
-	Revenue peaked in November 2023 and has gradually declined since
-	Electronics lead in revenue; Books lead in volume but lower revenue per order
-	Only 28.57% of signups convert into customers
-	Majority of conversions happen 60+ days after signup, suggesting onboarding friction
-	54.4% of buyers make more than one purchase
-	A small number of products generate a large portion of total revenue
## Insights
### Financial Insights
-	Revenue is concentrated in a few top-performing products; the top 5 SKUs account for 21.1% of total revenue. Diversifying product exposure could help mitigate risk.
-	Books and Clothing categories drive high unit sales but generate lower revenue compared to Electronics, which continues to dominate in value.
-	The company’s AOV of $512.58 is driven by fewer items per transaction, indicating strong premium product performance.
### Conversion & Retention 
-	Only 28.57% of users who sign up go on to make a purchase — a significant drop-off. 
-	The majority of customers who convert do so 60+ days after signing up, signaling a long lead time and a clear opportunity for early lifecycle engagement campaigns.
-	Retention rate sits at 54.4%, showing that over half of the customers who do purchase return to buy again. This underscores the potential value of investing in loyalty and retention programs.
### Product Performance
-	Books generate the highest overall revenue among all product categories, totaling over $119K, which indicates strong sales performance and widespread customer demand.
-	Electronics appear in the top-selling products list by revenue but do not lead in total category sales, indicating they are high-value items purchased less frequently.
## Recommendations
-	Accelerate first-time purchases through targeted onboarding campaigns, as most conversions currently occur 60+ days after signup.
-	Broaden product focus by promoting mid-tier performers to reduce overreliance on top-selling items, which contribute a disproportionate share of revenue.
-	Expand retention initiatives (e.g., loyalty programs, reorder incentives) to capitalize on the 54.4% repeat purchase rate and grow customer lifetime value.
